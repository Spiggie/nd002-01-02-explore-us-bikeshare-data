# Explore US Bikeshare Data

This is the second project for [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree][uda-da].

The project's goal is to "make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington."

The data needed to be read from csv files and processed using Python's well-known libraries [Pandas][python-pandas] and [NumPy][python-numpy]. The user should be guided through the program and be able to get some computed statistics, like popular times of travel, popular stations, or user info.
